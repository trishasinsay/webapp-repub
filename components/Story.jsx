          <p>I am not quite sure were to start with this review. Abbi Glines has been one of my go-to authors for a while now and she never fails to disappoint. Abbi&apos;s latest YA series is filled with heartbreak, love and family set in the West. Two years ago Maggie witnessed the unbelievable. She watched her mother be murdered by her father. Shortly after she stopped talking. Maggie doesn&apos;t want to relive the pain of telling her story over and over, and if she doesn&apos;t talk 
            no one would ask her. West&apos;s father is dying of cancer, he is barley holding it together and he is angry. Both Maggie and West who are harboring painful secrets find their way too each other, and both know how wrong their attraction 
            is but know that they need each other. For West Maggie is someone to trust, who listens to him and doesn&apos;t judge. For Maggie it gives her hope. Until Friday Night is told in alternating point of views, both equally enjoyable. 
            Maggie is quiet and observant, a quality that enables her to see beneath people&apos;s exterior to how they really feel. She easily saw through West, something that not even his football buddies was able to see through. Maggie&apos;s silence doesn&apos;t 
            discount her kindness towards people, even people who treat her horribly. West? He is literally the opposite of Maggie. He is loud, obnoxious, vulgar, and especially crude towards girls. West used girls as a distraction of pain. Even while 
            he was becoming closer to Maggie, he had a girl he was using by his side. Obviously he was a character I typically wouldn&apos;t have liked, but there was just something about him that I had hope for. I loved seeing how he went from a complete asshole, 
            to someone Maggie could rely on. I enjoyed the romance, though I wish it wasn&apos;t the &quot;Wow, I will never be good enough for her.&quot; or &quot;He doesn&apos;t want a girl like me.&quot; Kind of thing. It also made things complicated when West was fooling around with 
            other girls. Though eventually we get to watch them fall in love, giving something to the other that they need to make it through the days.  Overall, I really loved Until Friday Night. The only problem is that I am use to Abbi&apos;s New Adult novels 
            and expected this one to be steamy. So I was slightly disappointed in that aspect, though it didn&apos;t take away from the enjoyment of the story for me. I am really looking forward to the next book in The Field Party series.
